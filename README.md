This is a frontend exercise built with HTML/SASS/Javascript + Parcel (bundling).

The design is responsive (mobile-first) and the styles follow the BEM name standard.

For the form validation, I'm making use of the [Constraint validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Constraint_validation) WEB API. I used that same API for custom validation messages to the user - messages are displayed natively by the browser (they aren't DOM nodes). The password must have at least one capital letter; it uses pattern (regular expression) validation.
